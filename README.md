# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model, compile, traing and evaluate the model then optimize it. 

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup using neural networks and create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. The study will consist of 3 technical analysis :
- Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
- Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
- Optimize the Model


## Results 

### Data Processing
We first examine the data to identify the variables that are considered to be the target, features or should be removed from the dataset for our model.
The charity dataset contains information on EIN(Enployee Identifier), NAME, APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, INCOME_AMT,SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, STATUS, and ASK_AMT.

- The variable(s) considered as a target for our model is "IS-SUCCESSFUL" coulumn. It's the most important variable in the dataset as it determines the effectiveness of the fundings. 
- The variable(s) considered as features for our model are APPLICATION, TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, INCOME_AMT,SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, STATUS, and ASK_AMT.
- The variable(s) considered to be removed are the "EIN" and "NAME" columns as they are not relevant for our model and can create confusion.
