# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model, compile, traing and evaluate the model then optimize it. 

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup using neural networks and create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. The study will consist of 3 technical analysis :
- Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model
- Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model
- Optimize the Model


## Results 

###Preprocessing Data for a Neural Network Model

- variable(s) are considered the target(s) for the model : IS_SUCCESSFUL
- variable(s) are considered the feature(s) for the model : all variables except EIN and NAME
- variable(s) should be removed for your model: EIN and NAME
 


### Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model


### Optimize the Model
